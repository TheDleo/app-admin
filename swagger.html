        <p>
            Use of our API requires SSL3.  If you plan on making requests from Curl, or your Native SDK, make sure you are using version 3.
            <br/>
            For example, in curl: <b>curl - 3 url</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Your API Key</b><br/>
            Your “api key” to talk to our API is your App Name as defined in the Administration App,
            For each request, you can :
        <ol>
            <li>
                Append app_name=yourappname to the querystring or
            </li>
            <li>
                Send a request header called <b>X-DreamFactory-Application-Name</b> with the value of your app name.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p><b>Authentication</b>
            <br/>
            If your application is not part of the guest user’s role, then access to any service or data components will require authentication.
            <br/>
            To authenticate a user, simply POST a JSON string to /user/session that takes on the following format: ‘{“email”:”email_value”, “password”:”password_value”}’
            <br/>
            If successful, in the response, you’ll see a session_id has been created.<br/>
            <b>Very Important</b> : For all future requests to the API, you’ll need to pass the session_id as a new request header called <b>X-DreamFactory-Session-Token</b>
